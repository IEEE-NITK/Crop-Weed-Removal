Mentors Vishal and Rohit were explaining the plan they had about how to proceed further.
They had divided the work in 3 major parts as Algorithm for segmentation, path planning and path following.
They explained about all three in brief and asked us to do some self-exploration on each topic so that we can decide which one can go for.
Manan was also present there, providing his feedback over required topics and gave few leads to serach on.
