	1)Crop and weed will be detected in 'segmentation' task and output of it will be in form of classes which will be defined for weed and crops.
	2)from those output classes, path plannig will obtain cordinates of rectangle around detected weed and crops.
	3) path plannig will sloved by A* algorithm in which weed cordinates(center point of rectangle) will treated as node points and crop rectangles as blocked path.
	4)Output of path planning will be of 2 types of cordinates - a)targets b)corners where bot has to take turn.
	5) So for task 3 'path following', configuring speed and directions with motors will be done according to cordinates.
	6) we have kept some flaws as overlapping of rectangles on hold for now.
